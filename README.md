# Mono.Cecil

Mono.Cecil is a library to generate and inspect programs and libraries in the ECMA CIL form.

To put it simply, you can use Cecil to:

Analyze .NET binaries using a simple and powerful object model, without having to load assemblies to use Reflection.
Modify .NET binaries, add new metadata structures and alter the IL code.
Cecil has been around since 2004 and is widely used in the .NET community. If you're using Cecil, or depend on a framework, project, or product using it, please consider sponsoring Cecil.

Read about the Cecil development on the development log.

To discuss Cecil, the best place is the mono-cecil Google Group.

Cecil is a project under the benevolent umbrella of the .NET Foundation.
